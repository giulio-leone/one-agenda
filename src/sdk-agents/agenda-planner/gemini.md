## ⚠️ CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS

1. **Respect working hours** - Never schedule outside user preferences
2. **Honor dependencies** - Blocked tasks cannot start before blockers complete
3. **Preserve energy** - Schedule demanding tasks during peak hours
4. **Include breaks** - Cognitive recovery is non-negotiable
